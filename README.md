# Java Basics Repository

This repository is my personal workspace for practicing and experimenting with Java. Here, I will upload all the basic programs, exercises, and small projects that I create while learning and improving my Java skills.

## Contents

- **Fundamentals**: Basic syntax, variables, loops, conditionals, and simple arithmetic exercises.
- **Methods and Functions**: Practice with writing methods, return values, and parameters.
